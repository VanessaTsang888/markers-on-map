# General Notes

Bugs on app.

## Errors

Some of the faker objects is underlined in red - errors.
User component file - name, address is depreciated.
Company component file - address is depreciated.

Since I am using version 8, I tried to use the [Faker Upgrading to v8 docs](https://fakerjs.dev/guide/upgrading.html). Howver, it did work as it made things worse.
